Homework 3 for ENGR 102 

Introduction

This Homework will ask you to apply concepts, principles, and techniques from several modules. You will need to work with 1-2 classmates to solve a small programming problem. To do this you will need to 1) write an algorithm, 2) come up with a testing plan, 3) create a Python script using the methods provided, and 4) demonstrate the script's correctness with the test plan results.

You will also each turn in a short report describing your strategy and experience working with a group (the report is a separate individual submission).

The programming portion of this Homework asks you to compute the z-score for items in a data set. Z-scores are a statistical computation that tell us how far an element in a data set is from the mean. It's a measurement of standard deviations that indicate whether a data point is typical or anomalous. The formula for the z-score of a population item x is 

z = (x- µ) / σ

Where µ (mu) is the population mean, and σ (sigma) is the population standard deviation. The z-score of the mean of a population is always 0 (since it has a distance of 0 from itself). In a population with a normal distribution, the z-score of the lowest and highest population values will sum to zero (since they will be equally distant from the mean on either end of the distribution). You can read more about z-scores here.

As a starting point, you will have a Python script that calculates and for three different predefined data sets.


What you must do

With the Exercise 3/Homework 3 Group in Canvas that you joined in Exercise 3: Homework 3 Preparation (Group Homework), you must do the following:

Review the starter code shown below. Your task is to complete the function at the bottom of the code so that it emulates the given formula.
Review and refine your existing plan to allocate the work among your team members. For example, you might decide that one student will write the first draft of the algorithm, another will check it and write tests, and the third can implement the algorithm in Python. 
Draw up your testing plans (your test cases and method for obtaining expected outputs). You may use Sheets like in Exercise 3, use other software instead, or do it by hand. 
Write an algorithm to solve the problem and create either pseudocode or a flowchart to represent it.
Complete the program so that the function produces the correct output using the given parameters. Do not change the function name or parameters, or any of the other functions in the code. It is OK if you want to add additional functions, such as functions that help automate your testing processes. You can do this work directly in the Snippet, or you can use another IDE of you want.
Test your code and document the test results. Your documented tests (in your report) should include at least 2 cases that aren't already in the grader's test_z_score_function() in the starter code.
Adjust the script as needed until the tests produce the expected output.
Include a list of group members who participated in the work in the function comment provided for that purpose. 
Note that it's up to your team to decide how you will handle version control when more than one of you work on the code. If your team decides to use GitHub, you can install GitLinks to an external site., create a repositoryLinks to an external site., and make it privateLinks to an external site. (if you prefer). (Students recommend Git it as a tutorial for those wanting to learn to use GitHub. Git and GitHub will be required in many of the classes in this program, so this is a good opportunity to get acquainted with it.)

Reminder: the point of this assignment is to work as a group. Once your group members are chosen or assigned, you are not allowed to move yourself to a group by yourself.
